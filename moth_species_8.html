This large, imposing and wonderfully coloured species not only boasts an impressive appearance as an
adult, but the larva is also notable for being large, and resembling an elephant's trunk in appearance,
though no elephant has large eye spot markings on its trunk, as seen upon the larva of this species!
The larva can inflate its forward body segments to enlarge the eye spots, giving the larva a resemblance
tio a small snake - an example of fright colouration. Larvae feed upon various Willowherbs, though they
have in recent years been observed feeding upon cultivated Fuchsias in addition to their traditional choice
of Willowherbs.
