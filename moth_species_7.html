Just a decade ago, this species would have been considered a spectacular find in the Runcorn area, as its
range at that time was restricted to locations in the south of England. However, climate change has led to
a dramatic northward expansion of its range, and the species can now be found in many areas in the north-west
of England. <b>NOTE:</b> This species has a relative, the Dark Bordered Beauty (<i>Epione vespertaria</i>) that is
a Red Data Book species.
