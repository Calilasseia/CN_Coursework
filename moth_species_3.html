A familiar sight at night in deciduous woodlands with open clearings, and possessing a ghostly appearance
when flying around a light source, such as the mercury vapour bulbs used for moth trapping. One of the more
exotic-looking members of the UK moth fauna, this species is surprising common, and can be enticed to present
itself in any location where its larval foodplant, Ivy, is present in sufficient abundance. This is one of the
numerous UK moth species whose larvae resemble twigs in appearance - the larvae are superbly camouflaged when
resting on stems of the foodplant.
