This is one of the many UK spiders that lack a common or vernacular name, and only has a scientific
name. It prefers moist habitats, such as wetlands, deciduous woodland receiving frequent rainfall, and
has a patchy distribution in England, with its main strongholds in the south and midlands, though a
cluster of records centred upon the south of the River Mersey into North Wales exists in the biodiversity
database, with its local stronghold being positioned between the River Mersey at Runcorn, and the River
Dee through Chester.
