This ichneumon wasp is awaiting identification, and as an illustration of the scale of the problem
these insects pose, there are no less than THREE THOUSAND species of ichenumon wasp in the UK fauna!
These insects lay their eggs inside the larvae of other insects, and the wasp larvae consume their host
from the inside out as they develop. Numerous species are kleptoparasites of Lepidoptera larvae, while
others choose beetle larvae as their hosts, and some are specialists on Diptera (true flies). Note the
ovipositor at the rear of the abdomen of this specimen, which identifies it as a female.
