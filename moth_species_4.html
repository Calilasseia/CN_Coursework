One of several moths with "Emerald" in the vernacular name, and the largest thereof, as the name suggests.
This species may be found in numbers where its larval foodplant, Birch, occurs, and is one of the more
spectacular summer visitors to moth traps. It shares with the other "Emerald" moths, a tendency to fade in colour
fairly quickly after emerging from the pupa, and the colour can fade to almost beige after two or three weeks
of adult life, so freshly emerged specimens are the premium choice for the photographer aiming to display
this species at its finest.
