Among the largest of the British moths, this species rests in a manner resembling a collection of dead
leaves, and is superbly camouflaged when adopting its typical resting posture. Like numerous other hawk
moths, this species can be remarkably tame, and is easily persuaded to rest upon one's hand to pose for
photographs of a somewhat different nature from the usual biological recording photos! As the name suggests,
the larval foodplants are Black Poplar and White Poplar, though the lage and imposing larvae wull also feed
upon the leaves of Aspen and various Sallows.
