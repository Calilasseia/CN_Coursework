	Norton Priory is a former mediaeval monastery located in Runcorn, Cheshire, associated with a manor house of later
	construction, the latter having been converted into a museum in 2018. Follow the link in the sidebar to learn more
	about this historic site, and the occupants thereof over different historical periods.
	</p>
	<br>
	<p class="Indent">
	The site is home to large stretches of ancient deciduous woodland, that has remained thankfully untouched by
	malign human activity for around 800 years, and as a consequence, boasts an interesting and diverse invertebrate fauna.
	During nearly a decade of biological recording at the site, I have photographed numerous species of invertebrates,
	principally moths observed during moth trapping, but also various other invertebrates that have been attracted to the
	light trap, such as various beetles, assorted Ichneumon wasps, caddis flies, lacewings ,various members of the Order
	Hemiptera (true bugs, hoppers, aphids etc), spiders and millipedes.
	</p>
	<br>
	<p class="Indent">
	Click on the buttons below to view the different galleries of invertebrates found at the Norton Priory site. Each
	gallery provides clickable thumbnails taking you to portraits of the individual species found at the site, Note that
	where possible, each specimen is provided with a date of observation, and an Ordnance Survey grid reference indicating
	where on the site the specimen was found.
	</p>
	<br>
	<p class="Indent">
	All data on the species observed, is sent to relevant County Recorders for <abbr title="The Watsonian Vice-Counties are geographical divisions of the UK,
that were compiled by H. C. Watson in 1852, to provide a standard
geographical framework for the recording of scientific data in the UK.
VC58 is the designation for Cheshire, as defined by historical
boundaries, rather than recent administrative boundaries. For more
in-depth information, see the Wikipedia article covering this topic.">VC58</abbr>, and through them to the rECOrd
	local biodiversity records centre, based at Chester Zoo. Data is then subsequently passed on to the National
	Biodiversity Network (NBN), and added to their Atlas. More information about rECOrd and the National Biodiversity
	Network can be obtained by clicking on the links in the sidebar to the left. Additionally, a button is provided to
	launch the UK Grid Reference Finder webpage, which allows you to find the Ordnance Survey grid reference for any
	location in the UK, by moving the map around and right-clicking on your location of choice. Likewise, to maintain
	consistency with past historical records, a button is provided to take you to the Vice-County locator, which supplies
	your correct Vice-County based upon your OS grid reference.

<p>
Very briefly, I am David Edwards, a volunteer biological recorder
who has been compiling biological recording data in the Halton area
since 1996. I have taken in excess of 70,000 digital photos of the
insect fauna of the locality, to provide evidence of sightings of
species of interest, and the data I have supplied has become part of
the repositories of both rECOrd, the local biodiversity recording
organisation for Cheshire, and the National Biodiversity Network.

By the way, the image on the button you clicked on to pop up this
brief biography, depicts a Green Hairstreak butterfly sitting on my
finger posing for the camera!
