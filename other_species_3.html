Cockchafer beetles are  familiar sight to moth trappers during May and June, when the adults are
active and seeking mates. One of the unusual features of this species, is that the number of "fingers"
on the antennae are diagnostic - females have six, males have seven. These insects are also notable
for being a source of amusing mayhem around a light trap, and they can actually constitute a hazard to
exposed light bulbs, courtesy of the fact that these beetles are heavily armoured, and have a habit of
trying to crash into the light bulb!
