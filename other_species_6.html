This is a particularly unusual insect, which took me a week to identify upon account of it
resembling <i>nothing</i> I'd seen before! This is <i>Biorhiza pallida</i>, a gall wasp that
alternates between completely different adult generations. The first generation consists of
wasps that <i>look</i> like typical small wasps, and which are divided into male and female
individuals, mating sexually, and laying their eggs in Oak leaves, The larvae then feed within
the galls produced, and produce a second generation of adults, which by contrast with the first
generation, are all female, wingless, and reproduce parthenogenetically! The individual depicted
above is a member of that second, wingless and parthenogenetic generation.
